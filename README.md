**FAQ:**

1. Do I have to use my real Steam account?

	**Answer**: No, you do not have to. You should make another account just for your
	servers and make sure Unturned is in your library.
			
2. Is this a virus?

	**Answer**: No. The source code for Restart.exe and Start.exe are in the AutoIT .au3 files.
	sed.exe and wget.exe are GNU ports to Windows and can be found here:

	Sed: https://github.com/mbuilov/sed-windows (4.7)
		
	Wget: https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/ (1.20)
			
3. My antivirus detects Restart.exe and Start.exe as viruses!

	**Answer**: As stated in #2, there are no viruses and any detections are false positives. Add an exception
	in your antivirus. If Windows Smartscreen is preventing you from running the exe simply hit "More Info"
	then hit "Run Anyway".
			
4. The console looks really weird. What's wrong with it?

	**Answer**: Make sure the file is in UTF-8 format! GitHub encodes it into UTF-8-BOM, which for some reason
	messes up in CMD.

**Editing the script:**

Inside the lib folder there are two .au3 files. These are the source code for Restart.exe and Start.exe
They are written in AutoIT and can be edited using a text editor such as Notepad++. They can be compiled
using AutoIT's tools.
I have tried my best to comment everything. Feel free to edit anything to your liking.

If you want to modify this script, please give me credit! :)
